I completed my undergraduate education at Qingdao University, majoy in math and minor in finance. I completed master education at University of Dayton with math major focusing on statistics.\n#Goals for MADA\nI have learned some theoretical statistical inference. The most parts Iâ€™d like to learn is how to transform the theoretical knowledge into application about solving the problem in real world. And how to present to others in a simple and clear way.\n#Research interests\nMy primary interest is in infectious disease, especially influenza. Recently I am exploring the ferret vaccination data.\n#fun fact\nI lived in Qingdao(China) for more than twenty years, which is a beautiful costal city. There are many delicious seafood there. Qingdao is a city which is surrounded by mountains and sea.Before I moved to Gerogia. I lived two years in Ohio which has a colder winter and have thick snow there in winter.\n#Experience\nBefore I came to UGA, I had math/statistics backgrounds. I have used R/SAS for solving and displaying statistics problems. I have used Matlab for solving PDF problems. I have used Latex for display statistics problems and formulas."
