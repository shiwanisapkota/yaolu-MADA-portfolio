#Background

My name is Yao Lu. I am a second year PhD student concentrating in data analysis and modeling. I completed my undergraduate education at Qingdao University, majoy in math and minor in finance. I completed master education at University of Dayton with math major focusing on statistics. 

#Goals for MADA

I have learned some theoretical statistical inference. The most parts I'd like to learn is how to transform the theoretical knowledge into application about solving the problem in real world. And how to present to others in a simple and clear way.

#Research interests

My primary interest is in infectious disease, especially influenza. Recently I am exploring the ferret vaccination data.

#fun fact

I lived in Qingdao(China) for more than twenty years, which is a beautiful costal city. There are many delicious seafood there. Qingdao is a city which is surrounded by mountains and sea. Before I moved to Gerogia, I lived two years in Ohio which has a colder winter, and Ohio has thick snow there in winter.

#Experience

Before I came to UGA, I had math/statistics backgrounds. I have used R/SAS for solving and displaying statistics problems. I have used Matlab for solving PDF problems. I have used Latex for display statistics problems and formulas.
